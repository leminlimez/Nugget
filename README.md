# Nugget
Unlock your device's full potential!

Sparserestore works on all versions iOS 17.0-18.2 developer beta 2. There is partial support for iOS 18.2 developer beta 3 and newer.

**Mobilegestalt and AI Enabler tweaks are not supported on iOS 18.2+.** It will never be supported, do not make issues asking for when it is supported.

Make sure you have installed the [requirements](#requirements) if you are on Windows or Linux.

This uses the sparserestore exploit to write to files outside of the intended restore location, like mobilegestalt. Read the [Getting the File](#getting-the-file) section to learn how to get your mobilegestalt file.

Note: I am not responsible if your device bootloops. Please back up your data before using!

## Requirements:
- **Windows:**
  - Either [Apple Devices (from Microsoft Store)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9np83lwlpz9k%3Fhl%3Den-US%26gl%3DUS&ved=2ahUKEwjE-svo7qyJAxWTlYkEHQpbH3oQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0rZTXCFmRaHAifkEEu9tMI) app or [iTunes (from Apple website)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106372)
- **Linux:**
  - [usbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd) and [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice)

- **For Running Python:**
  - pymobiledevice3
  - PySide6
  - Python 3.8 or newer

## Running the Python Program
Note: It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .env # only needed once
# macOS/Linux:  source .env/bin/activate
# Windows:      .env/Scripts/activate.bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # only needed once
python3 main_app.py
```
Note: It may be either `python`/`pip` or `python3`/`pip3` depending on your path.

The CLI version can be ran with `python3 cli_app.py`.

## Getting the File
You need to get the mobilegestalt file that is specific to your device. To do that, follow these steps:
1. Install the `Shortcuts` app from the iOS app store.
2. Download this shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d6f0a136ddda4714a80750512911c53b
3. Save the file and share it to your computer.
4. Place it in the same folder as the python file (or specify the path in the program)

## Building
To compile `mainwindow.ui` for Python, run the following command:
`pyside6-uic qt/mainwindow.ui -o qt/ui_mainwindow.py`

To compile the resources file for Python, run the following command:
`pyside6-rcc qt/resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py`

The application itself can be compiled by running `compile.py`.
